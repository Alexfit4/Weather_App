## App Description:
- Make a weather app that will show the city of which the user searched for.
- When user clicks search the info for that current weather is shown to the right, and the weather for the next five days is shown underneath.
- The recently searched cities are displayed below the search button which the user can click on and show the weather for that specific city.
- If the user refreshes the screen the weather they have searched for and the current weather the searched will still be shown.
- Also when the user clicks clear history the recent  weather shown will be erased from the website and also the local storage.
- I used open weather api to call the weather.
